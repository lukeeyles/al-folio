While working at Isle Utilities, I have taken part in technology scans in a wide range of areas including water efficiency, sludge treatment, smart irrigation, and resource recovery.

This work involved scoping out over 300 technologies to be included in technology longlists, refinining longlists to shortlists by selecting unique technologies that best fit the client's needs, and researching to find key information on each shortlisted technology. Following this, each technology would be rated by desirability, viability, and feasibility to identify prospective trial opportunities.
