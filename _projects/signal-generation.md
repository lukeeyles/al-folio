While working at Jenkins Engineering Defence Systems, I created a Signal Generator MATLAB GUI app, which could generate and overlay many different types of signal to transmit via a software defined radio. Signal types implemented include continuous wave, chirp, frequency modulated, phase shift keying, and quadrature amplitude modulated. The overlay functionality enabled experimentation involving simulating radio waves received from multiple sources.
