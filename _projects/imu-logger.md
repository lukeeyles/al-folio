In my work at Jenkins Engineering Defence Systems, I designed a system to autonomously record sensor data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to a single board computer using C++. The system needed to be robust, as it would be left unmonitored for months at a time, and also needed to be resilient to power outages.

Power outages posed a data corruption risk, and in the worst case could corrupt the entire filesystem. To reduce this risk, I set the file system to read only at all times, unless I was writing data. I also created a service to start the program automatically when power was available again, and ran experiments to confirm the systemâ€™s resilience to outages.
