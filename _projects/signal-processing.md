While working at Jenkins Engineering Defence Systems, I expanded the capabilities of their in-house Signal Analyser MATLAB GUI app to include advanced filtering and visualisation, using MATLABâ€™s Signal Processing Toolbox.

The app can import signal data from multiple sources, including directly receiving from a software defined radio (SDR). Filtering options I implemented include bandpass, concatenating pulses, and windowed averaging in frequency domain and time domain. Visualisation options include time domain, frequency domain, instantaneous phase/frequency, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, spectrogram, and chirp width.

I also ported the app from the old GUIDE MATLAB app builder to the new App Designer environment and added documentation, improving the app's maintainability and ensuring it would continue to be useful.
