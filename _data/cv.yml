    - title: <a href="/projects/capstone">Exoskeleton Arm Control Software - Capstone</a>
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Redesigned and programmed control software for the JEXO exoskeleton arm at UTS Robotics Institute, using C++ with ROS.
        - Implemented a seamless and extensible controller switching system, enabling testing different control schemes or switching to remote control without restarting.
        - Created extensive documentation to reduce onboarding time to the project, improving the functionality of JEXO as a research platform.
        - Integrated a Gazebo simulation to enable offline testing of control schemes.
    
    - title: Spotify Playlist Generator - Personal Project
      year: DEC 2022
      description:
        - Programmed a Python script to pull popular posts from a music forum and create a Spotify playlist of the featured songs.
        - Used Regex to analyse post titles for artist and song name.
        - Interfaced with the Spotify API to search for each song and add it to the playlist, using fuzzy matching to account for mistakes or differences between the forum and Spotify listing.
        - Improved performance by creating a database of previously matched songs using pandas.

    - title: Underwater Robot Localisation - Mechanical and Mechatronic Design
      year: SPR 2021
      description: 
        - Researched and designed a unique localisation method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as part of a team in collaboration with Thales.
        - Calculated mean and worst-case localisation error for the method using MATLAB, and proposed an iterative solution to overcome large error values.
        - Documented the solution in a detailed report, and developed a simulation in C++ with ROS as a proof of concept to demonstrate the method in action.
    
    - title: <a href="/projects/tic-tac-toe-bot">Tic-Tac-Toe Bot - Robotics</a>
      year: AUT 2021
